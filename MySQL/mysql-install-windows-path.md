# Customizing the PATH for MySQL Tools

To make it easier to invoke MySQL programs, you can add the path name of the MySQL *bin* directory to your Windows system PATH environment variable:

- On the Windows desktop, right-click the **My Computer** icon, and select **Properties**.

- Next select the **Advanced** tab from the **System Properties** menu that appears, and click the <button>Environment Variables</button> button.

- Under **System Variables**, select **Path**, and then click the <button>Edit</button> button. The **Edit System Variable** dialogue should appear.

- Place your cursor at the end of the text appearing in the space marked **Variable Value**. (Use the 
**End** key to ensure that your cursor is positioned at the very end of the text in this space.) Then enter the complete path name of your MySQL *bin* directory (for example, C:\Program Files\MySQL\MySQL Server 8.0\bin)
